It’s fast, minimal, and built for writers, devs, and anyone who wants a smooth markdown writing experience and is powered by a simple backend for exporting files.
It’s built with **React** on the frontend and **Node/Express** on the backend so you can run everything together without extra setup.

## 💡 Why I Built This
As someone who writes technical articles regularly, I got curious about what it'd take to build a markdown editor that's clean and fast as well.
That curiosity pushed me to build Tier Markdown, a lightweight, personal editor designed to make writing feel calm and focused.
